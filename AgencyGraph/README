###`Short:`
This class creates a graph, it can either choose to randomly create it, or it can create a specific graph.
Each part of the graph is a graph node, which each contains a person.
The karma is the amount of times you can ask a certain person to spread the agency.
There is the ability to also do the following:


###`Detailed Description`
#####The graph is the main class that does the work
>It is constructed by its only constructor, which has no arguments.
One has to add a Graphnode to the Graph to start using the GraphNode, through the method addNode(GraphNode) . 
You can add an edge between two Graphnodes Through addEdge.
The final method which does all the work is the findPath method, which will display on the system how it navigates through the graph.

#####GraphNode is the object that will be in the graph and holding people
>It has one constructor, which takes in a person to hold
it has a few instance variables, which one holds a person, visited is for a queue in our transverse method, and numconnections which tells how many connections this class is connected to
it has a few getters, setters and changers. 
it also has a few overriden methods from object


#####People is the object which will be held by graphNode
>It has 2 constructors, that of a string where the string is the name of the person to create.
The other constructor creates a random name of 5 letters long, allowing for 11881376 total names.
each person has a identical id assigned to each of them.
they each have a randomly set karma, but you can use the .setKarma to change thier karma.
There are other getters, setters and incrementors.
There is also a toString Override.

#####Other Used Classes
>GraphEdge is a list of edges that connect 2 graph nodes together, and it has some overriden methods
